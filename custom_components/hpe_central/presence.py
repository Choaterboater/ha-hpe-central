"""Presence rules, kept free of Home Assistant so they can be tested alone.

A client is home as soon as any sighting (live stream message or REST sweep)
lists its MAC, and away once nothing has listed it for AWAY_AFTER_SECONDS.
Before the first sighting it counts as away. Every client seen is kept, so any
of them can be tracked; join / leave transitions are reported for events.
